# Progressive Web Apps Collection

Welcome to my collection of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). This repository is dedicated to showcasing a series of applications that leverage the latest web capabilities to deliver a user experience akin to native apps.

## What are Progressive Web Apps?

Progressive Web Apps are a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.

A PWA should be:

- **Progressive**: Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
- **Responsive**: Fit any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or forms yet to emerge.
- **Connectivity independent**: Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
- **App-like**: Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.
- **Fresh**: Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
- **Safe**: Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
- **Discoverable**: Identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
- **Re-engageable**: Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
- **Installable**: Allow users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
- **Linkable**: Easily share via URL and do not require complex installation.
